LibDOS is some sort of MS-DOS-like terminal, using a partial implementation (only the fun parts) of Turbo C (Copyright (c) 1987, 1988 Borland International, Inc.).

**Development in progress.**

## Who might want to use this library

- Nobody
- Someone learning to program in C/C++.
- Anyone who needs retro terminal graphics (i.e. ASCII characters), e.g., for a game (c.f. Dwarf Fortress, etc.)
- Anyone who feels ncurses is not "retro enough"
- Anyone who needs an ncurses equivalent that's even more of a pleasure to use
- Anyone who wants to use this library
